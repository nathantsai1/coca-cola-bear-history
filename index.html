            <h3>The first advertisement first took shape in France, 
                in 1922. More ads appeared, over the next 70 years,
                in newspapers. However, since the spread of the TV, Coca-Cola
                began showing digital commercials - 27 of them, in 1993. They created
                their "Always Coca-Cola" campaign, spreading their logo around
                the world. They used new technology to show this,
                including computer animations</h3>
