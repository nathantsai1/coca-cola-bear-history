                <br> Coca-Colabegan showing digital commercials - 27 of them, in 1993. They created
                <br> their "Always Coca-Cola" campaign, spreading their logo around

            <h3 class="t4"><br><br><br>When asked to develop an innovative commercial for Coca-Cola, 
                <br> creator Ken Stewart thought about drinking Coke at the movies. As a puppy, 
                <br> Mr. Stewart's Labrador Retriever had resembled a polar bear. Mr. Stewart 
                <br> saw his dog, thought about polar bears and how they would go to the movies, 
                <br> and the idea for "Northern Lights" was born. In the commercial, the polar 
                <br> bears watch the aurora borealis (the "movie") and drink from bottles of Coca-Cola.

            <h3 class="t4">
                The Senior Vice President of Advertising at Columbia Pictures, Ken Stewart, was approached by the head of marketing at his company to design an innovative commercial for Coca-Cola. He didn't just want to make an advertisement, he wanted to make a message, and a good feeling that could be associated with the brand. 15 years and lots of struggling later, Stewart finally had an idea, stemmed from his dog, who resembled a polar bear as a puppy. Using the new animation technique and a lot of effort in collaboration with the design team, he was able to create the first ever Coca-Cola commercial - capturing good feelings associated with the brand.
