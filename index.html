                <br> over the next 70 years, in newspapers. However, since the spread of the TV, 
                <br> Coca-Colabegan showing digital commercials - 27 of them, in 1993. They created
                <br> their "Always Coca-Cola" campaign, spreading their logo around
                <br> the world. They used new technology to show this, including computer animations</h3>

            <h3 class="t4"><br><br><br>When asked to develop an innovative commercial for Coca-Cola, 
                <br> creator Ken Stewart thought about drinking Coke at the movies. As a puppy, 
                <br> Mr. Stewart's Labrador Retriever had resembled a polar bear. Mr. Stewart 
                <br> saw his dog, thought about polar bears and how they would go to the movies, 
                <br> and the idea for "Northern Lights" was born. In the commercial, the polar 
                <br> bears watch the aurora borealis (the "movie") and drink from bottles of Coca-Cola.

                The Senior Vice President of Advertising at Columbia Pictures, Ken Stewart,
                <br> was approached by the head of marketing at his company to design an 
                <br> innovative commercial for Coca-Cola. He didn't just want to make an 
                <br> advertisement, he wanted to make a message, and a good feeling that could 
                <br> be associated with the brand. 15 years and lots of struggling later, 
                <br> Stewart finally had an idea, stemmed from his dog, who resembled a polar 
                <br> bear as a puppy. Using the new animation technique and a lot of effort in
                <br> collaboration with the design team, he was able to create the first ever 
                <br> Coca-Cola commercial - capturing good feelings associated with the brand.

            <h3 class="t4 left absolute t8">
                Stewart created the first modern polar bear commecial, named "Nothern Lights,", 
                <br> where the bears enjoyed each other's company, watching the aurora borealis, 
                <br> and drinking Coca-Cola. The commercial had no words, not focusing on 
                <br> the dialog, but instead the music. The ad was very popular, and thus the 
                <br> magic of the polar bears became a central part of Coca-Cola's ads, for 
                <br> the next 25 years.
                <br> ‚ÄúI wanted it to be magical. I had no voices in the commercial.‚Äù Stewart says, 
                <br> ‚ÄúMy intuition said that as soon as I put words in that bear's mouth it 
                <br> wouldn't be magical anymore.‚Äù

            <h3 class="t4 right absolute t9">
                Polar bears have become a beloved staple in TV commercials! Back in 1994, 
                <br> they made a big impact during the Olympic Games ads, wowing audiences with 
                <br> their unexpected skills in sports like luge and ski jumping. But it's that 
                <br> unforgettable Christmas commercial that really stole hearts. In it, a sweet 
                <br> family of polar bears, including adorable little cubs, happily picks out the 
                <br> perfect holiday tree, perfectly capturing the warmth and joy of the season.

            <h3 class="t4 left t10 absolute">
                The company once released a special campaign with 1.4 billion white cans featuring 
                <br> adorable polar bears, alongside their usual red ones. It was such a heartwarming sight! 
                <br> Unfortunately, those special cans have disappeared, and I haven't seen any polar 
                <br> bear branding since. I don't really understand why they stopped‚Äîit was such a beautiful 
                <br> reminder of these majestic creatures and the need to protect them.

                <br><br>I get that using a polar bear on a product might feel a bit off to some, though. But still, 
                <br> I can't help but miss those bears. They added a touch of magic to the cans.
