# Coca-bear origins

## What is this?

This is an article about the origin of the Coca-Cola Polar Bear, and who created it. It was designed to be a good winter-themed website that teaches people more about this popular brand, and (let's face it) this cute mascot. 

## Why did I make this?

I made this to teach others about the history of this famous mascot. Through building this website, I learned a lot about the person who created the mascot, Ken Stewart, and how the polar bear became very popular. It all started, though, by seeing the cute bear in Coca-Cola's store in Las Vegas.
